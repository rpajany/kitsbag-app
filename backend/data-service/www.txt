import logger from './logger.js';

logger.info('Server started...');
logger.warn('Something looks fishy...');
logger.error('Something went wrong');

🛠️ Tips
Use logger.debug(...) for detailed dev logs.

Use logger.error(err.stack) to log full error traces.

You can set log level dynamically using an env variable:

----------------------------------------------------------------
 To run multiple Node.js apps on the same machine (e.g., development server or production server), you need to make sure each app:

Listens on a different port

Optionally runs in the background (e.g., using pm2 or forever for production)

Is isolated properly (different folders, different .env if needed)

Example 1: Run Two Apps Manually with Different Ports
App 1 (e.g., app1/index.js):

import express from "express";
const app = express();
const PORT = 3000;
app.get("/", (req, res) => res.send("App 1 is running"));
app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`App 1 running on port ${PORT}`));

App 2 (e.g., app2/index.js):

import express from "express";
const app = express();
const PORT = 4000;
app.get("/", (req, res) => res.send("App 2 is running"));
app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`App 2 running on port ${PORT}`));

Run each app in its own terminal:

# Terminal 1
cd app1
node index.js

# Terminal 2
cd app2
node index.js

Example 2: Run Both with pm2 (Recommended for Production or Multiple Apps)
Step 1: Install pm2
npm install -g pm2

Step 2: Start Both Apps:-
pm2 start app1/index.js --name app1
pm2 start app2/index.js --name app2

pm2 kill

Step 3: Save and Auto-start on reboot

pm2 save
pm2 startup

View apps:

pm2 list

Example 3: Use concurrently (Development Only)
Install concurrently if you want to run both apps from one terminal:

npm install --save-dev concurrently

In a parent package.json:

"scripts": {
  "start": "concurrently \"node app1/index.js\" \"node app2/index.js\""
}

Run:

npm start
-------------------------------------------
Workaround for Windows:-
If you're trying to make PM2 start your Node.js processes automatically after system reboot on Windows, you can do it manually using Task Scheduler.

Here’s how to set it up:

Step 1: Find PM2 location
PM2 is usually installed globally. Find its path (it’s typically in %APPDATA%\npm):

Example:


C:\Users\pajany\AppData\Roaming\npm\pm2.cmd
Step 2: Create a Scheduled Task
Open Task Scheduler.

Click Create Task (not basic task).

On the General tab:

Name: PM2 Startup

Check "Run with highest privileges"

On the Triggers tab:

Click New → Begin the task: At log on

On the Actions tab:

Click New

Action: Start a program

Program/script: pm2.cmd

Add arguments: resurrect

Start in: (optional) C:\Users\pajany

Click OK and test by restarting or logging off and logging back in.

Step 3: Save Current Processes
You've already done this:


pm2 save
This stores the list of running apps in a dump file (dump.pm2), which is used by pm2 resurrect to bring them back.

Optional: Test it manually
You can test the startup resurrection manually before relying on Task Scheduler:


pm2 resurrect
If your services start correctly, your task is correctly configured.

Let me know if you want to auto-launch PM2 in the background at Windows service level, which requires more advanced setup using nssm or converting the app to a service.
